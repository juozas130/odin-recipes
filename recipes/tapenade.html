    <h1>The Best Tapenade In The World</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>My version of an Italian classic.</b></p>
    <img src="../images/tapenade.png" alt="Tapenade" width="700">
    <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Green olives, 100g</li>
            <li>Cornichons, 25g</li>
            <li>Capers, 20g</li>
            <li>Pistachios (unsalted), 50g</li>
            <li>Spring onions, 1 bunch</li>
            <li>Mixed herbs (parsley, cilantro, mint, dill, etc.), 1 bunch</li>
            <li>Wholegrain mustard, 1Tbsp</li>
            <li>Red wine vinegar, 2Tbsp</li>
            <li>Olive oil, 2Tbsp</li> 
            <li>Hot water (not boiling, around 80&deg;C), a few splashes</li>  
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>   
            <li>Fresh baked sourdough for serving (toasting doesn't hurt either)</li>  
        </ul>
    And this is how you make it:
        <ol>
            <li>Toast pistachio nuts in a pan while moving constantly. Alternatively, you can roast them for 10mins in 180&deg;C oven (careful not to burn them!). Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>While pistachios are resting, chop green olives, capers, cornichons and spring onions. </li>
            <li>Finely mince whatever herbs you are using. Mix with other prepared ingredients from the step above.</li>
            <li>When the nuts have sufficiently cooled off, chop them with a knife and add to the bowl with the rest of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add mustard, olive oil, red wine vinegar. Mix thoroughly. </li>
            <li>Add some hot water, one splash at a time, to thin the mix to the consistency of your liking.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a serving bowl. Spread a generous amount on a slice of sourdough and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
